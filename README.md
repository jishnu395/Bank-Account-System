# Bank Account System

Bank Account System is a Java-based command-line application that simulates basic banking operations. It demonstrates core Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) principles such as encapsulation, inheritance, and method overriding. Users interact via a simple console menu to create accounts, deposit and withdraw funds, view balances, and check transaction histories. The project includes a base BankAccount class and a specialized SavingsAccount subclass that introduces an interest mechanism to enhance functionality.

## Features

Account creation: Initialize new bank accounts with a starting balance and an account holder name.

Deposit & Withdraw: Add or remove funds from the account with validations (e.g. no overdrafts).

Balance inquiry: Display the current balance of the account.

Transaction history: Maintain a log of all operations (account creation, deposits, withdrawals)

Inheritance & method overriding:

 -> BankAccount as the base class, and
 
 -> SavingsAccount subclass that may override certain behavior (e.g. adding interest)

User-friendly CLI menu: Navigate different operations via a text-based menu

Error handling: Basic checks for invalid inputs, negative amounts, insufficient funds
